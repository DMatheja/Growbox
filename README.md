# Growbox
Open Source Code and instructions for making your own grow box using off-the-shelf components

Current version is 1.0
Everything works, and the logic is ROCK SOLID.
I even included safety precautions, for example, if the heater or the CO2 runs for longer than 120seconds (2minutes) it will turn them off once.
They will get turned back on if they need to.
This is just so that if they are turned on, and a sensor fails/disconnects, the system will turn them off eventually.

###TL:DR The code is definatly not perfect, but it works.###

The only problem is that the screen doesn't draw it perfectly and every 5 sec there is a short flicker, but it is totally usable.






Why this license?
I chose the GNU License because I like Open Source, and I don't have a problem with people making money from my work. BUT, your product will also need to be Open Source.
